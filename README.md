ISTE 340 Project 2

Endpoints You MUST Use
For “Project 2” you must display data from the following “Nodes,” i.e., “endpoints:”
•	ABOUT
•	DEGREES
•	MINORS
•	EMPLOYMENT
•	PEOPLE – just the faculty
•	RESEARCH
•	FOOTER – just the “copyright” is required.
•	COURSES – pay attention to the “But you will need this!” note on the “ist.rit.edu/api” web page.
•	MAPS – as shown in class, this returns a “map” not JSON; just click on the “MAPS” hyperlink in the “NODES” column.  You will have to provide a “nicely” scaled iframe on you web page to display the map. 
If you wish to add more content to your project, the following endpoints may also be included:
•	RESOURCES
•	FOOTER – other sub-root nodes in addition to the already required “copyright.”
•	CONTACT FORM
Do not include “NEWS.”  It is out of date and not a “value add” to you project.
